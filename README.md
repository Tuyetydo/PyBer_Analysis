# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
My manager Omar has assigned me a new project from V. Isualize, the CEO of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. She is looking for a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. As well as using Pandas and Matplotlib, to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide two technical analysis deliverables with a written report.  The requested deliverables to be provided to V. Isualize are:

- [x] Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- [x] Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
- [x] Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis

### Results

In this dataframe that I was able to create with the data provided, there is insightful data to look at. The data is compared with rural, suburban, and urban. To begin with, it is not surprising that the total rides for urban was 13 times as many as rural and over 2 times as many as suburban due to the general population difference. This pattern was similar with the total number of drivers and total fares which makes sense with the idea of supply and demand. But this relationship begings to shift when we are looking at the average fare per ride and average far per driver. This can be viewed as the distance for rural and suburban should be further per ride in comparsion to urban.

### Summary
Three business recommendations I would suggest based on the data:
- I would suggest looking at idle time in the urban drivers because there was 1625 total rides with 2405 drivers so there was a significant number of extra drivers. 
- There is a spike in total fare in all types of communities at the end of Feburary and would be insightful to look into this further.
- Both rural and suburban had more rides versus drivers and could have potential business growth in targetting opportunities with demand.
